# Getting Started

http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/

1. The application is running on localhost8080, this is the port that I set. Feel free to change the port if need be on the application.properties file
2. Open the swagger-ui  and load the data onto the database using saveDataFromExcelFile post method (the data is already being read from the resources directory into the application)
3. Use the caluculatePoints endpoint to set your source and destination. It will return the vertices back as list and we can see the  shortest path (i.e the name will show from sourcr to destination)
4. The other endpoints perform the basic crud to the dataset
