*The design used the Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path to sove this problem since it is a about finding the shortest path in a graph.
*We are using the adjacency list as a representation of paths followed
*The assumption in this case is that all the data must be loaded into the graph initally. 
*In later releases we can improved by considering other algorithms which might perform better in a prodution setting such as BFS
